<p>
  Sports are one of my favorite things to do, watch, and talk about.  I was introduced at a young age to almost every sport.</p>  <p>I think my dad really wanted to give me to opportunity to play whatever I wanted, because he wasn't really able to as a kid.  He would take me to all my games and always support me.</p><p>  Sports gave me so many friendships over the years and I am still friends with people I played with years ago.  When I play something like basketball - my favorite sport - I can just destress and really detatch from everyday life.  I hope to keep my passion throughout the rest of my life.
